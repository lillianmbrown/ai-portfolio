# Bolt Website Demo: Interactive Code Learning Platform

## Overview

This project is a lightweight interactive website I built using [Bolt](https://www.bolt.fun). It serves as a self-guided learning tool to explore the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a product leader, my goal was to gain confidence using low-code tools and strengthen my ability to coach product teams on experimentation and technical fluency.

## Purpose

My work at SafetyChain involved deeply technical collaboration, but I wanted to build something outside of that ecosystem to ensure my instincts and coaching weren't overly tied to one stack. This project helped me:
- Refresh foundational web development knowledge
- Explore the potential of AI-assisted prototyping tools
- Build empathy for new learners approaching web technologies
- Lead by example when encouraging product managers to experiment

## Reflections

This project grounded my understanding of how low-code platforms like Bolt function under the hood. It also gave me greater confidence in supporting and coaching others to prototype and experiment ‚Äî whether they're engineers, product managers, or new learners.

The ability to work iteratively, share progress visually, and tie it to product thinking is a key skill I aim to cultivate on any team I lead.

## Tech Stack

- Built in: [Bolt](https://www.bolt.fun)
