# Bolt Website Demo: Interactive Code Learning Platform

>Quick Take: A personal, hands-on project to explore low-code tools, strengthen my coaching ability, and test what it means to build with AI in a way that‚Äôs accessible and intentional.

## Overview


This project is a lightweight interactive website I built using [Bolt](https://www.bolt.fun). It serves as a self-guided learning tool to revisit the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî not just for curiosity, but as part of my commitment to staying technically fluent as a product leader.

I created it to deepen my understanding of low-code tools, model a learning mindset, and strengthen my ability to coach product managers through hands-on experimentation. Knowing the limits and opportunities of tools like Bolt helps me support my teams with clarity and confidence.


## Purpose

My work at SafetyChain involved deeply technical collaboration, but I wanted to build something outside of that ecosystem to ensure my instincts and coaching weren't overly tied to one stack. This project helped me:
- Refresh foundational web development knowledge
- Explore the potential of AI-assisted prototyping tools
- Build empathy for new learners approaching web technologies
- Lead by example when encouraging product managers to experiment

## Reflections

This project grounded my understanding of how low-code platforms like Bolt function under the hood, and gave me greater confidence in supporting and coaching others to prototype and experiment.

As a product leader, I believe strong coaching starts with doing. Just like I don't coach youth athletes on batting technique if I know I have bad form myself, I also don't want to coach product managers on prototyping unless I understand the tools firsthand. This hands-on experience helps me identify where I can lead directly and where to bring in engineering or design leaders to elevate the work.

By stepping into the learner role, I‚Äôm better prepared to guide others, ask sharper questions, and create a product culture that values growth, experimentation, and clarity ‚Äî especially when navigating emerging tech like AI.
