## How to Navigate This Portfolio in GitHub

You can think of this portfolio as a guided journey through my applied learning in AI product work. Start with a case study highlighting a specific product decision, continue with a hands-on technical project that explores building with AI, and finish with my personal thesis that outlines the values guiding those decisions.

- **[Form Builder Case Study](./form-builder-case-study/README.md):** A real-world example of choosing not to ship an AI feature due to user impact and clarity concerns.
- **[Bolt Website Demo](./bolt-website-demo/README.md):** A hands-on learning project using low-code tools to strengthen technical fluency and coaching.
- **[AI Product Thesis](./ai-product-thesis/README.md):** A values-driven framework for when, why, and how to build AI responsibly and inclusively.
- **[Coach Pitch Scorekeeping App](./coach-pitch-scorekeeper-app/prototype):** A mobile-friendly scoring app designed for the unique pace and rules of youth Coach Pitch softball.
    - **July 2025 Update:** Version 0.2 is live after real-world testing revealed key usability gaps


This space will continue to grow as I experiment, reflect, and build — always with the user in mind.
