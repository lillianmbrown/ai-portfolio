# AI Portfolio â€“ Lily Brown

I built this portfolio as a space to explore emerging tools, test ideas, and ask better questions about AI before I make product decisions that affect real people. I use this space to surface blind spots early, deepen my technical understanding, and ensure the tools I help build donâ€™t leave anyone behind.

## Purpose

This portfolio is both a playground and a professional statement. I created it to:
- Explore how AI tools can solve real user problems
- Test no-code/low-code platforms like Bolt and Loveable
- Share case studies and product thinking behind each experiment
- Demonstrate my hands-on curiosity and leadership as a product builder

## What's Here

- âœ… [AI Form Builder Case Study](./form-builder-case-study/README.md) â€“ when not to use AI and how to guide rollout responsibly 
- ðŸ§ª [Bolt Website Demo](./bolt-website-demo/README.md) â€“ exploring low-code tools and technical learning through hands-on prototyping
- ðŸ§  [AI Product Thesis](./ai-thesis/README.md) â€“ guiding principles for inclusive, thoughtful AI product leadership
- ðŸ’¡ More projects to come

## Tech Stack

- Built with: [Bolt](https://www.bolt.fun), exported as static site
- Hosting: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or Netlify (to be finalized)
- Style: Lightweight HTML/CSS with a focus on content and accessibility

## About Me

I'm a product leader with a track record in SaaS, systems design, and mission-driven organizations. My work blends innovation with human context, and Iâ€™m especially interested in building AI tools that empower the people who use them, while staying mindful of how easily exclusion can happen without intent.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a mom of two, a Girl Scout troop leader, and a youth sports coach. Whether Iâ€™m mentoring young Scouts or collaborating with executives, I care deeply about creating inclusive systems that help individuals and communities grow with confidence.
