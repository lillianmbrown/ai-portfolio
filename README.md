# AI Portfolio – Lily Brown

I created this portfolio to explore emerging AI tools, test ideas, and sharpen my product thinking in a rapidly evolving space. It’s a space for structured learning and reflection that helps me ask better questions, uncover blind spots early, and make product decisions that prioritize clarity, trust, and inclusion.

## Purpose

This is a working portfolio designed to demonstrate how I think, lead, and build when navigating emerging technologies like AI. I created it to:
- Explore how AI tools can solve real user problems
- Test no-code/low-code platforms like Bolt and Loveable
- Share case studies and product thinking behind each experiment
- Demonstrate my hands-on curiosity and leadership as a product builder

## How to Navigate This Portfolio

You can think of this portfolio as a guided journey through my applied learning in AI product work. Start with a case study highlighting a specific product decision, continue with a hands-on technical project that explores building with AI, and finish with my personal thesis that outlines the values guiding those decisions.

- **[Form Builder Case Study](./form-builder-case-study/README.md):** A real-world example of choosing not to ship an AI feature due to user impact and clarity concerns.
- **[Bolt Website Demo](./bolt-website-demo/README.md):** A hands-on learning project using low-code tools to strengthen technical fluency and coaching.
- **[AI Product Thesis](./ai-product-thesis/README.md):** A values-driven framework for when, why, and how to build AI responsibly and inclusively.
- **[Coach Pitch Scorekeeping App](./coach-pitch-scorekeeper-app/prototype):** A mobile-friendly scoring app designed for the unique pace and rules of youth Coach Pitch softball.
    - **July 2025 Update:** Version 0.2 is live after real-world testing revealed key usability gaps


This space will continue to grow as I experiment, reflect, and build — always with the user in mind.

## About Me

I'm a product leader with a track record in SaaS, systems design, and mission-driven organizations. My work blends innovation with human context, and I’m especially interested in building AI tools that empower the people who use them, while staying mindful of how easily exclusion can happen without intent.

Outside of work, I’m a mom of two, a Girl Scout troop leader, and a youth sports coach. Whether I’m mentoring young Scouts or collaborating with executives, I care deeply about creating inclusive systems that help individuals and communities grow with confidence.
