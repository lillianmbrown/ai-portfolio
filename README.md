# AI Portfolio â€“ Lily Brown

Welcome to my AI product portfolio. This site is my space to explore, test, and share how Iâ€™m learning by doing â€” building thoughtful, user-centered experiences that integrate AI without losing sight of clarity, trust, and equity.

## Purpose

This portfolio is both a playground and a professional statement. I created it to:
- Explore how AI tools can solve real user problems
- Test no-code/low-code platforms like Bolt and Loveable
- Share case studies and product thinking behind each experiment
- Demonstrate my hands-on curiosity and leadership as a product builder

## What's Here

- âœ… **AI Form Builder Case Study** â€“ when *not* to use AI and how we made that call  
- ðŸ”¨ **Prompt-to-Component Demo** â€“ Bolt-built prototype to test UI generation from text  
- ðŸ’¡ More projects to come â€” including data education tools and inclusive onboarding experiments

## Tech Stack

- Built with: [Bolt](https://www.bolt.fun), exported as static site
- Hosting: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or Netlify (to be finalized)
- Style: Lightweight HTML/CSS with a focus on content and accessibility

## About Me

I'm a product leader with a background in SaaS, systems design, and mission-driven tech. My work blends innovation with human context, and Iâ€™m especially interested in building AI tools that donâ€™t leave users behind.
