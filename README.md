# AI Portfolio â€“ Lily Brown

Welcome to my AI product portfolio. This site is my space to explore, test, and share how Iâ€™m learning by doing â€” building thoughtful, user-centered experiences that integrate AI without losing sight of clarity, trust, and equity.

## Purpose

This portfolio is both a playground and a professional statement. I created it to:
- Explore how AI tools can solve real user problems
- Test no-code/low-code platforms like Bolt and Loveable
- Share case studies and product thinking behind each experiment
- Demonstrate my hands-on curiosity and leadership as a product builder

## What's Here

- âœ… [AI Form Builder Case Study](./form-builder-case-study/README.md) â€“ when not to use AI and how to guide rollout responsibly 
- ðŸ§ª [Bolt Website Demo](./bolt-website-demo/README.md) â€“ exploring low-code tools and technical learning through hands-on prototyping
- ðŸ’¡ More projects to come â€” including data education tools and inclusive onboarding experiments

## Tech Stack

- Built with: [Bolt](https://www.bolt.fun), exported as static site
- Hosting: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or Netlify (to be finalized)
- Style: Lightweight HTML/CSS with a focus on content and accessibility

## About Me
