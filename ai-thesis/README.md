# AI Product Thesis: Inclusion, Clarity, and Thoughtful Application

## Overview

This thesis captures my evolving beliefs as a product leader working at the intersection of AI, usability, and impact. It’s not a manifesto — it’s a working foundation that guides how I evaluate, shape, and challenge the use of AI in real-world products.

## Core Beliefs

- AI should not be a default solution. It should be chosen deliberately, when its unique capabilities provide clear user value.
- Just because something can be personalized doesn't mean it should be. Predictability, clarity, and trust are often more valuable than novelty.
- User education is essential. Features built with AI should assume a learning curve and offer ways for users to grow alongside the tool.
- Marginalized users are often excluded from AI development not by intent, but by omission. If we don’t reach out to them during discovery, we risk structurally excluding them from the product itself.
- The best AI features do more than respond — they empower. The goal isn’t just faster; it’s better outcomes and more human alignment.

## Origins

This thesis emerged as I worked through:
- A case study in *not* implementing an AI form builder because it created too much ambiguity for a conservative user base
- A Bolt-based learning project that grounded me in core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Deep conversations about trust, inclusion, and the limits of automation in systems that serve real people

Each of these built on a decade of product work across enterprise SaaS, mission-driven orgs, and user education efforts. Together, they challenged me to move beyond buzzwords and toward purpose.

## Example Applications

- **Inclusion through code**: If your AI feature is built with language models or logic trained only on dominant user behaviors, who gets left behind?
- **Discovery framing**: Ask users not just what they want AI to do — ask what they're afraid it will do wrong.
- **Release pacing**: Introduce AI features in safe, constrained areas first (e.g. filters, charts), before expanding to core workflows.

## Closing Thought

AI is not magic. It’s logic at scale, shaped by human intent and bias. That means it carries both enormous potential and enormous risk. I believe the future of product leadership lies not in how fast we ship AI, but in how bravely we ask who it’s for — and who might be left out if we get it wrong.
