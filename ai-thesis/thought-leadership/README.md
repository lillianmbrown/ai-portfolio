# AI Product Thesis: Inclusion, Clarity, and Thoughtful Application

## About Me  
I’m a product leader with over a decade of experience spanning enterprise SaaS, mission-driven organizations, and user education. My focus is on building tools that support real people, not abstract users, especially those who are often left out of emerging technologies.

## Overview  
This is a working foundation for how I evaluate and shape AI features in real-world products. It’s grounded in experience, not hype, and guided by a commitment to usability, equity, and thoughtful application.

## Core Beliefs  
- **AI should be used intentionally, not automatically.** It’s a powerful tool, but not always the right one. Some problems are best solved with consistent, familiar patterns, especially where trust and clarity are essential.  
- **Users need predictability as much as they need personalization.** In many cases, reliability and transparency are more empowering than dynamic or novel experiences.  
- **AI adoption requires education.** Users can only ask good questions, explore possibilities, and build trust with an AI-powered tool if they understand how it works at a basic level. That makes education and onboarding a core part of responsible deployment, not an afterthought.  
- **Exclusion often happens through omission.** If we don’t seek out the needs of marginalized users during discovery, we risk embedding their absence into the logic of the product itself.  
- **AI should support better human outcomes.** It’s not about faster responses or flashier features. It’s about building tools that help people make more informed, confident, and inclusive decisions.  
- **Sustainability must factor into AI decisions.** AI consumes energy, time, and human attention. If it doesn’t serve a clear purpose, it shouldn’t be used.

## Context and Development  
These beliefs have been shaped through direct experience:
- Evaluating an AI-powered form builder and choosing not to ship it because it created unnecessary ambiguity for a risk-averse user base.  
- Completing a Bolt-based AI build to deepen my technical fluency and better understand what generative tools can and can’t do.  
- Leading product strategy in environments where trust, access, and education are as important as efficiency or innovation.  
- Observing patterns in no-code AI tools where vague or inconsistent logic, like string and boolean mismatches, is introduced either by accident or by design. These create scenarios where users spend more time or credits troubleshooting than building. This reinforced the importance of having enough technical awareness to spot and fix friction early.

These moments reinforced that *why* we build matters just as much as *how*.

## Applications in Practice  
- **Inclusive discovery:** AI features should be tested and validated with users across race, language, ability, and income, not just early adopters or assumed power users.  
- **Designing for predictability:** Some workflows need to function the same way every time. AI should not disrupt that unless it provides a clear and explainable benefit.  
- **Introducing AI gradually:** Starting with lower-risk applications like filters or summaries gives users room to build trust before encountering AI in critical workflows.  
- **Education as a product requirement:** If users don’t understand the logic behind AI outputs, they may disengage or misinterpret results. Product teams must invest in onboarding, tooltips, examples, and support materials that meet users where they are. The most powerful AI education is flexible. It offers “choose your own adventure” pathways that allow users to explore at their own pace, seek help when needed, or bypass when confident.
- **Build AI into familiar territory first:** Users are better able to evaluate AI responses when they already understand the subject matter. By anchoring early AI features in workflows where users have confidence, we create space for experimentation without high risk. If users don’t know the topic well, they may not know when the AI is wrong, which sets them up to fail. This makes it essential to design for trust, clarity, and recovery.

## Why It Matters  
Because AI carries inherent risks—of exclusion, of opacity, of environmental impact—it also carries a responsibility. If we choose to build with AI, then we must also choose to address the most urgent problems it touches: inequities in education, unequal access to technology, and the accelerating threats of climate change.

Used carelessly, AI amplifies power imbalances. Used deliberately, it can redistribute access, reduce friction, and support real human growth. That does not happen by accident. It happens when product leaders ask harder questions, design for the long tail of users, and prioritize clarity and care over novelty or speed.

If we are going to build with AI, we should use it to make the world more equitable and only apply it where it truly belongs.

## Final Thought  
AI is not a neutral force. It is shaped by the choices we make as builders. That includes who we involve in research, where we introduce AI, how we explain it, and whether it truly helps people achieve what matters to them. When we offer users real agency in education, exploration, and execution, we build tools that not only work, but also belong.
