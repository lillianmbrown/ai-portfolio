# AI Form Builder Case Study

## Overview

This case study highlights an AI-powered form builder I helped evaluate and shape while leading product at a compliance-focused SaaS company. It demonstrates how product leadership sometimes means saying no — even when a new feature is powerful and exciting.

## Project Context

The goal was to integrate generative AI into a form builder, allowing users to create complex forms using written prompts and image examples of existing documents. The results were promising for initial creation, but challenges arose during form editing, where the open-ended nature of prompts led to unpredictable results.

The users — primarily in manufacturing and compliance-heavy roles — were not yet comfortable navigating a tool with such variability. The transition from rule-based logic to probabilistic outputs felt disorienting.

## Strategic Decision

Instead of rushing rollout, the AI form builder was kept in **alpha and closed beta**, allowing continued refinement and user testing. The product strategy shifted toward more bounded use cases for AI, such as recommending filters or generating charts — areas where users already felt safe experimenting.

This approach allowed us to gradually introduce the AI paradigm without eroding user trust or clarity.

## Product Leadership Insight

This experience grounded my instincts as a product leader and deepened my understanding of how to adapt traditional UX principles to AI-powered interfaces. The hardest decision in product management is often knowing when to say no. With something as exciting as AI, that decision becomes even harder.

But the lesson remains: no feature is worth shipping if it comes at the cost of clarity or trust.

## Key Themes

- Responsible AI evaluation and rollout
- Understanding user readiness and risk tolerance
- Applying classic product strategy to emerging technologies
