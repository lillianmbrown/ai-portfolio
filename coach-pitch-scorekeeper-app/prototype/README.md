### Summary

This PR adds a new section to the Diamond Dugout Dash project: real-world usage insights from scoring two live Coach Pitch games. The new content includes learnings about interface gaps, common correction needs, and workflow oversimplification.

### What's New

- New `Real-World Use & Iteration` section in the README
- Screenshots already in place to complement feature overview
- Version updated to `v0.2 â€“ Post-beta iteration notes added (2025-07-06)`

### Why This Matters

This brings the project from prototype to tested MVP, aligning it more closely with product development cycles and demonstrating how I use field tests to drive iteration.
