# Diamond Dugout Dash: Coach Pitch Scorekeeping App  
**Type:** Prototype • Mobile Web App  

## Overview  
This project is a lightweight prototype for a simplified softball scorekeeping tool, designed specifically for Coach Pitch games. The goal was to streamline tracking for a league with unique rules (like a 6-pitch max per batter) that aren’t well supported by existing apps like GameChanger.

As a youth coach and product leader, I built this to meet real-world needs on the field — where speed, clarity, and adaptability are more important than advanced stats. The result is a mobile-first experience that simplifies inning tracking, pitch counts, base progression, and scoring.

## Purpose  
GameChanger and similar tools are designed for more advanced play. But in Coach Pitch:
- Batters only get 6 pitches  
- Fouls can count as outs  
- There is a 5-run limit for innings 1–5  
- Coaches need to track lineup order, pitches, and base progression — often while managing players

These constraints made it difficult to use conventional apps during fast-paced games. This tool was built as a focused solution: less clutter, faster inputs, and rules tailored to this format.

## Screenshots  

### Game Setup  
Set up team names and lineup order for each team. Players must bat in order; if a player misses their turn, it counts as an out.

## Reflections  
This prototype let me apply product instincts in a new space: building something hyper-specific to a problem I know personally. I used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to define requirements and iterate quickly in [Loveable](https://www.loveable.so) to test the concept visually.

If I were continuing forward with this product, I would:
- Test in real games (planned: 2 games on Saturday)
- Run discovery with other youth coaches for additional pain points
- Identify key areas for design polish before expanding features  

This is a clear example of how AI-assisted prototyping can accelerate real-world problem solving ![Uploading Game Overview.png…]()
— especially when combined with domain knowledge and user empathy.
